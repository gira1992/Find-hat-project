## Information of the project

The aim of the project was to generate a board game and ensuring the gameplay were handled correctly by logging in the console the outcome of the user input. This project was a great way to improve my knowledge and problem-sovling skills within JavaScript.

Type npm install in your terminal to get the "prompt-sync" dependency necessary for the game.
Make sure you are located inside the root directory with "main.js" file.
Run node main in your terminal to start the game.
Follow set up rules and play the game!
